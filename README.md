# Take Home News

The Take Home News app is a demonstration of my basic react and css skills. Three things I focused on implementing outside of smooth and simple functionality are URI encoding, useParams hook and simple yet fun button styling. URI encoding is a way to safely encode the `title` parameter in the URL in my GetData component. UseParams is a hook in React that allows you to access parameters in the URL of a component. You can use it to retrieve information from the URL and use it to render specific content based on that information. For example, in a news app, you could use `useParams` to retrieve the title of an article from the URL and display the article's content on the page. Lastly, I added animation to my catagory buttons just for a little fun and to feed my passion to learn more CSS animation techniques.
